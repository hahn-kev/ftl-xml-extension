<text name="renegade_tributed">Fortunately, the MV ship accepts the tribute in turn for letting you live.</text>
<text name="renegade_tributed_chaos">You offer a tribute in desperation, but the Renegade doesn't display any sort of reaction whatsoever. Instead it is the gnome that scoops up your scrap, and the ship cuts contact with you. Better to not ask questions.</text>

Dominant Faction: Galactic Union
Rebel Threat Level: Medium-Low
Locations of Interest: Earth 

The Union Coreworlds are also home to Earth, the homeworld of man-kind. Heavily protected by the Militia, this is no place to play villain, unless you're willing to suffer the consequences. Despite this, in recent times a mysterious pirate faction known as the Brood have begun terrorizing Union settlements abroad. Keep a look out for these elusive pirates - there might be a reward for taking them down.

This sector is the central base of operations for the Militia. It holds their armories, hangars, barracks, and the like. It would be unwise to stir up trouble here.

Dominant Faction: The United Federation
Rebel Threat Level: High (Neutral Fleet)
Locations of Interest: Node 17 Memorial

Since the start of the Multiversal War, the Federation has made great effort to establish broader and stabler relations with the rest of the galaxy to fight off Rebel intrusions. This sector is perhaps in recent times even more the center of Federation activities than Node 17, especially given the Rebel fleet's headed towards the capital.
</text>

<text name="atlas_engi">Name: Engi Harmony
Type: Friendly
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: Engi Harmony
Rebel Threat Level: Low
Locations of Interest: Harmony Link

The Harmony is not to be confused with The Harmony, led by The Harmony. Records also show the remains of some massive super structures and a warrant out for a band of smugglers. Be on the lookout for anything out of the ordinary.
</text>

<text name="atlas_zoltan">Name: Zoltan Capital
Type: Friendly
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: Zoltan Ministry
Rebel Threat Level: Medium-Low

The Capital is the center of the Zoltan Ministry. Be cautious of not just Duskbringers, Pirates, and Rebels, but the Ministry's watchful eye as well. Your Federation authority might have some worth here, but it's nothing compared to the Ministry's.
</text>

<text name="atlas_orchid">Name: Gathering Gardenworlds
Type: Friendly
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: Orchid Gathering
Rebel Threat Level: Low

The Garden Worlds are the center of Orchid space, and are home to Rt'lak Et, the Grand Orchid Gardens and where the Orchids' ships and weapons are grown.
</text>

<text name="atlas_vampweed">Name: Confederate Coreworlds
Type: Neutral
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: Vampweed Confederacy
Rebel Threat Level: Medium-Low

The Coreworlds of the Confederacy are the stronghold of their industrial complex, and also the home of their Premier and the representative legislatures of component states. This sector is likely to have the most nationalist groups of the Confederacy - but, fortunately, such groups will be less sympathetic to the Coalition as others.
</text>

<text name="atlas_crystal">Name: Crystalline New-Homelands
Type: Hostile
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: Crystalline Empire
Rebel Threat Level: Low
Locations of Interest: Crystalline Capitol

These are, in fact, the second Homeworlds of the Crystals. After being forced out of their sector by greedy "pioneers", the Crystals have immigrated to this sector, and called it their own. Some of the staunchest xenophobic Crystals reside here, so be careful who you come in contact with...
</text>

Type: Friendly
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: The Free Mantis
Rebel Threat Level: Low
Locations of Interest: Ministry fleet and Bishop vessel detected

This ex-Zoltan sector is an often visited location by the Free Mantis. Ministry citizens are the prime prey for the Free Mantis clans as revenge for the violent rejection they received during their immigration.
</text>

<text name="atlas_outcast">Name: Theocracy Badlands
Type: Friendly
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: Rock Outcasts
Rebel Threat Level: Low
Locations of Interest: Turban

On the very rim of Theocracy space, the so-called Badlands have become the densely populated center of the Outcast societies. This place is said to be rich in both trade and culture, but mentions of heavy Theocracy resistance as well as an influx of SSLG agents sent by the Crystalline Empire could prove dangerous for your journey. At the center of it all is Turban, a rich city and one of the best established in all of Outcast space - and the prime target for any potential Theocracy attacks.
</text>

<text name="atlas_rebel">Name: Rebel Stronghold
Type: Hostile
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: The Rebellion
Rebel Threat Level: !CRITICALLY HIGH!
Locations of Interest: Rebel Hangars

This sector is in the very center of Rebel space, and is a prime spot for the most prominent Rebel operations. If you had any hopes of seeing a friendly face from the Federation here, stifle it immediately. Only a fool could dream something like that here.
</text>

<text name="atlas_pirate">Name: The Black Market
Type: Neutral
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: Pirates
Rebel Threat Level: Medium
Locations of Interest: Sky-Drifter Casino, Smuggler Shipyards

Type: Hostile
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: Rock Theocracy
Rebel Threat Level: Low

The Rockmen have fortified their homeworlds and hold complete control over this sector, or at least so they claim. Try not to get on the bad side of the Elders, and maybe you'll make it out alive.
</text>

<text name="atlas_lostsun">Name: Lost Sun Stronghold
Type: Neutral
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: Lost Suns
Rebel Threat Level: Low

This sector was once a holy site for the Rock Theocracy to worship the Crystals, but has since been converted into a defensive stronghold for the Lost Suns and their operations.
</text>

<text name="atlas_dusk">Name: Duskbringer Stronghold
Type: Hostile
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: Duskbringers
Rebel Threat Level: Very High

While once a vibrant Ministry sector, the Duskbringer movement has since gained a tight grip over this territory and transformed it into their base of operations. The Rebel presence here is significantly high as well, as it seems Universe 1 is focusing a large effort to capturing the zone. Moreover, a band of Syndicate forces also made its way in.
</text>

<text name="atlas_coalition">Name: Coalition Stronghold
Type: Hostile (Nebula)
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: The Coalition
Rebel Threat Level: Low

This sector wasn't always a nebula, but scans show a massive concentration of synthetic nebulae here. How has the Coalition managed to alter an entire sector like that is a mystery - one among many likely hidden in their designated stronghold.
</text>

<text name="atlas_auto">Name: Central Automated Shipyards
Type: Hostile
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: The Rebellion
Rebel Threat Level: Very High (Auto Fleet)
Locations of Interest: Central Power Core

This sector is the center of Auto-ship production. With a much larger staff of Engineers protecting it, don't be surprised to run into a few well armed Engineer vessels along with the usual Auto-ships of this sector.
</text>

<text name="atlas_lanius">Name: Lanius Swarmlands
Type: Neutral
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: Lanius Swarm
Rebel Threat Level: Low

During the extensive Lanius hibernation, this sector was ravaged by pirates and Ghosts. Now the swarm has awakened once again, and they aren't pleased. However, maybe with a bit of scrap, you can please the Lanius enough to let you through unharmed.
</text>

<text name="atlas_slug">Name: Slug Homeworlds
Type: Hostile (Nebula)
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: Slug Kleptocracy
Rebel Threat Level: Low
Locations of Interest: Expensive Slug pleasure barge seen traversing this sector

The Slug Homeworlds are the hub of scum and thieves living the high-life on their riches. Be careful who you trust, especially when they're a Slug.
</text>

<text name="atlas_clan">Name: Guild Territory
Type: Neutral (Nebula)
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: Exotic Hunters Guild
Rebel Threat Level: Low
Locations of Interest: Guild hunting grounds

This sector is the home, hunting grounds, and gathering spot of the EHG. Though the EHG is part of the Kleptocracy still, they hold a large amount of territory. Unfortunately, now that you're here, you'll likely end up on their list of prized hunts until you can escape.
</text>

<text name="atlas_shell">Name: Geniocracy Coreworlds
Type: Neutral (Nebula)
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: Shell Geniocracy
Rebel Threat Level: Medium (Auto Fleet)
Locations of Interest: Long-range Federation distress call registered

Though the Shells evolved on the same planet as the Slugs, they were forced out by their much more aggressive cousin species. The Shells have settled here, and have set up heavy defenses to protect their territory.
</text>

<text name="atlas_morph">Name: Shell Science District
Type: Hostile (Nebula)
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: Shell Geniocracy
Rebel Threat Level: High (Auto Fleet)
Locations of Interest: Genetic Enhancement and Research Laboratories

Oddly enough, a large amount of data provided by the sector seems to have been wiped by the creators of the entry point. There's some gibberish in here as well, and a large warning printed advising travelers to stay away. It's too late to go back now, so hopefully we don't find ourselves in a crisis situation right off the start!
</text>

<text name="atlas_leech">Name: Eargen Capital
Type: Neutral (Hazard)
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: Eargen Republic
Rebel Threat Level: Low
Locations of Interest: President Tyrdeo's mansion, Tony Sr's Mega Shopping Center Deluxe

This sector not only houses the center of the Eargen Republic, but also a lesser-known civil war that also involves the Inquisition, Coalition, and the Vampweeds. None of these factions are friends with the Federation, but hopefully they'll be distracted enough with each other to not notice you. Seeing as an Inquisition commander known as Gora has been seen entering this sector not long ago, this might prove to be a feat to pull off.
</text>

<text name="atlas_ghost">Name: Spectral Wastelands
Type: Neutral (Nebula)
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: Vagabond Clans
Rebel Threat Level: Medium
Locations of Interest: Ancient Ruins

This sector once belonged to the Dynasty, but some unknown force came through here, wiping out most of their colonies. All that remains are scavengers and a few Dynasty vessels sent to reclaim what little they can. Rumors speak of a band of mercenaries called 'Spook Chasers' who linger in this sector.
</text>

<text name="atlas_dynasty">Name: Spectral Capital
Type: Hostile (Nebula)
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: Spectral Dynasty
Rebel Threat Level: Very High (Auto Fleet)
Locations of Interest: Dynasty Capitol, Ancient Ruins

Reports show the Rebellion deployed a massive carrier vessel to this sector not too long ago. A ship of such size must have been carrying a vessel of equally immense threat, but no accurate data is provided. Let's hope the resident Ghosts have already taken care of it and you can move on in peace.
</text>

<text name="atlas_monk">Name: Illesctrian Oasis
Type: Friendly (Nebula)
Unique: True
Dominant Faction: Zoltan Ministry

One of the largest megacorps within the Union, Wentworth Innovations is the family corporation of none other than Admiral Vance himself. However, due to his absence, VP Cayden Stimly has taken temporary charge. Under his direction, the company has become exceptionally aggressive towards competition, and holds the Union leadership under a spell of bribery. Tread with caution.

<text name="database_argeonn">Argeonn Taepor, Aquarian for "Merchants of the Fine Silk", is a massive inter-dimensional smuggler operation led by a wealthy Aquarian named Ocym. It is rumored Argeonn had a second, mysterious co-founder, but they have long since left the picture. Ocym and most of Argeonn's operations are headquartered in the aptly named Black Market, where his massive roaming casino/resort 'Sky Drifter' can be found. Argeonn holds no loyalties except to its own contractors - it'll serve anyone willing to pay, whether it be Federation, Rebel, Coalition, or competing pirate clans like Tiiikaka. Argeonn is typically "ignored" by Federation enforcers much like with the Syndicate clan as it keeps pirates who would elsewise be dangerous under a strict ruleset.</text>
<text name="database_syndicate">The Syndicate is a powerful guild of mercenaries, providing organization, ships, and crew to aspiring guns-for-hire in return for a cut of their pay. Founded by an extremely wealthy but elusive ex-MFK Ace known only by the monicker "Vael", the Syndicate also employs a circle of 12 elite assasins known as the Angels who do Vael's dirty work from the shadows.</text>
<text name="database_tiiikaka">Founded originally by an exiled Suzerain named Reikaaakili during the onset of the Federation-Mantis War, Tiiikaka is responsible for introducing the first major circulation of Engi slaves to the Mantis Hive. After earning back his status as Suzerain on behalf of the queen, Tiiikaka's leadership passed onto his son, Kataaagingi. Tiiikaka continues to circulate slaves to several major powers, but their largest buyer remains the Hive. With very close ties to Queen Leikonpliiinakra, Tiiikaka ships gain favorable routes through otherwise dangerous Mantis space.</text>
<text name="database_clairvoyants">The Clairvoyants are often synonymous with the idealogy of Sethnian (the native name for the Slugs) Traditionalism. They were once the protectors of the Slug Empire until the discovery of the Galactic Union and its ideals began to influence the average Slug lifestyle, birthing the idealogy of Sethnian Reformism. After the fall of the Empire and the rise of the Kleptocracy, the Clairvoyants were disbanded for some time - until king Slocknog, a staunch supporter of Traditionalist ways, brought back the party as part of his campaign. Though Slocknog was exiled from Slug lands after the conclusion of the Slug Expansion Wars, the Clairvoyants remain as dangerously armed and trained elite protectors of Slug territory.</text>
<text name="database_lsversuscoal">The Lost Suns, led by Admiral Ariadne Obadann, are a radical group of revolutionaries deadset on the overthrowal of the Rock Elders and the Theocracy. Though their fight is not with the Coalition directly - the collapse of the Theocracy (one of the strongest military forces in the Coalition) would be disastrous. For this reason, the Federation chose to ally with the Lost Suns, providing them supplies in return for the promise that Ariadne's plans for a new democratic government stay separate from the Theocracy. Admiral Obadann has been... difficult to cooperate with, but some Lost Suns have taken it upon themselves to keep the Federation's favor by launching assaults on Coalition depots and supply chains.</text>
<text name="database_hektar">Hektar Industries is a Slug corporation founded by Carle Hektar, and has been run by his descendents for decades, longer than the Federation has even been around. Hektar, while responsible for the production of almost all furniture and appliances in the Kleptocracy, also specializes in military goods. However, under the ownership of the current CEO, Billy Hektar, the company has seen a decline as the Zulfiqar Corporation takes their place as the top weapons manufacturer, and Hektar investors slowly begin to drop from the company. Hektar is known for shady business practices but is largely overlooked as their headquarters reside in Kleptocracy space, out of the reach of the Federation.</text>
<text name="database_vek_incident">After Senator Wright's disastrous provocation of several hostile pirate tribes living in abandoned Union territory, the group known simply as 'The Brood' invaded the Union Coreworlds and planted the eggs of a monstrous insectoid alien species known as the Vek. As the four mega-corporations headquartered on Earth at the time were unable to coordinate a proper effort to destroy the Vek, the job fell into the hands of interdimensional mercenaries such as yourself. Armed with mech suits to rival the mountain-sized insects, the squad known as the Rusting Hulks managed to rescue most of Earth's population and infiltrate the Vek hive. However, the Renfield Bombs used by the mercenaries caused massive earthquakes and tidal movement that flooded most of the remaining landmass, forcing many of the survivors of the Vek attacks to evacuate anyways. Because of this, the Rusting Hulks and similar renegades are unpopular within Union space for their reckless behavior.</text>
<text name="database_brood">While most people only know the three most infamous pirate clans, Tiiikaka, The Syndicate, and Argeonn, the Brood is a smaller but more locally infamous threat to the Union. After the conclusion of the Federation Civil War, newly elected Union Senator Oscar Wright began a campaign to recover former Union territory lost during the war. However, these abandoned sectors had become home to a variety of pirate clans, and the sudden wave of Militia 'intruders' angered them. The Brood were among them, and as revenge for the loss of their homes they swarmed the Union Coreworlds, planting eggs of many dangerous alien species on densely populated planets including Earth. Wright's continued efforts to fight the Brood have not helped his image, but the Union's war on the Brood seems to be far from over.</text>
<text name="database_hideo">Hideo Tanaka, a human male aged 67, is the founder and current CEO of Hephaestus Shipyards, the first corporation to achieve the status of a "gigacorp" alongside Arcadia and Zulfiqar. Hideo is a known human-supremacist and member of the underground human-exclusive groups in which talks of the original Rebellion began. Though Hideo has done his best to hide his support for the Rebel forces, Hephaestus was responsible for the construction of the original Rebel fleet. Hideo is also an avid ship collector and space-flight historian, and spends a large portion of his immense wealth gathering parts of rare vessels of all origins. It is believed he might even have been responsible for the theft of several parts of the original Multiverse Drive, though an official investigation has never been conducted.</text>
<text name="database_kazaaak">Every child born in the Federation or the Hive knows the tales of Kazaaakplethkilik. A character shrouded in fear, admiration, and controversy, Kazaaak is beloved by some and hated by many. Though he fought for the Hive during the Federation-Mantis War, it was suspected he played both sides, also acting as an informant for the Federation, along with accusations of aiding several Free Mantis soldiers in escaping from Hive enforcers. Despite all of this, it's no secret that Queen Leikonpliiinakra and Kaz have been an item several times in the past, a black mark on Leikonpliiinakra's otherwise golden image among the Mantis. Though born a worker, Kaz managed to rise the ranks in the Hive and for a time held a status similar to an "honorary Suzerain". He is better educated than most Mantis, which only makes him deadlier.</text>
<text name="database_bishop">The Mantis Bishops, formerly classified as members of the Episcopacy, are the highest ranking Mantis in the Hive beneath the queen herself. Originally founded under queen Riiipiokinith, mother of Leikonpliiinakra, the Bishops receive a full formal education unlike most Mantis, and are responsible for governing the Hive's utmost important affairs as well as the training and education of future Suzerains. Bishops are rarely seen outside of the Hive except on urgent missions. The Bishops are fed from birth a special concoction similar to the Queen's own pheromones, allowing them to grow larger and stronger than the average Mantis. Treat Bishops the same way you would an MFK Ace - do not engage unless at the utmost necessity.</text>
