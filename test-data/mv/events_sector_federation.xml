"The nature of our movement is that we stand to make room for the superior lifeforms in this galaxy - to give them their rightful place. It is a fact that more often than not, the Zoltans are who possess these superior characteristics, but that is not to say ALL Zoltans do. Those we have found in this unholy temple of false peace have betrayed their species to work hand in hand with lesser beings, thus becoming lesser themselves."

The galaxy should have already accepted the Zoltans as the superior race - we have the better tech, the better culture, and the better minds. Sure, there are species who are stronger, or better adapted to certain environments - but there is a place for them in our new galaxy. It just won't be at the top.

We are millions strong and growing, and our methods harm no one but those directly opposed to us. You are nothing but Renegade filth, who are you to say such things? You don't know politics, you don't know-" The Zoltan is cut off by abrupt gun-fire, as the guards open fire while the Duskbringers are distracted.
