	<text>Hard to say why the nearby Leech ship has chosen to attack you. A death wish perhaps? You wouldn't be surprised, but you would have preferred if they had just asked instead of forcing it upon you!</text>

	<text>The introduction of the Leeches into the Coalition seems to have been only a half-hearted gesture on both sides. The Republic doesn't seem all too keen on acting in the interest of the Coalition, and it's highly probable the Coalition is only helping fight the revolutionaries because of the number of soldiers the Leeches can provide. Now, enough politics. A threat approaches!</text>
	<text>For all the Coalition's build up as some grand galactic threat, they really haven't seemed to do much besides the Aquarian Invasions. Sure, it's a nuisance you have to deal with ships like the one barreling towards you right now, but at least they aren't directly attacking the Federation anymore.</text>
	<text>"Geh, you know what's worse than a stupid smelly Leech? A stupider, smellier Federation captain!" The Coalition captain receives several high-fives from his crew, then attacks!</text>

You were the ones that put me in charge, I only tried to help!" Tyrdeo lets out a giant sob. "I know it was stupid to give the Vampweeds flowers, but I was only trying to make friends!

The crowd joins in, chanting and practically drooling at the mouth for the prospect of killing the former President. In one final effort, Tyrdeo turns to you, pleading. "Please, I know I made mistakes, I know the Coalition is your enemy, but you can't let them do this! I don't want to be president anymore, I never did! I just want to live!"</text>

You're just another corrupt, power hungry wannabe trying to seize power through force!" cries one angry bystander, and the rest agree. Soon the mob has swarmed Alkram and things turn bloody. In the chaos, Tyrdeo breaks free and rushes over to you. "I might faint. I haven't been this terrified in all my life. I've soiled myself! Oh wait, sorry, you didn't need to know that. Anyways - please, take me with you! I can do more than trim hedges, I promise!" You agree, but before you can make it back to the ship, Tyrdeo ducks back into his palace and returns with his bird which he loads into the cargo. What a strange, strange man.</text>
